   Connection Parameters to golosd daemon.

   Start the golosd daemon with the rpc-endpoint parameter:

      ./programs/golosd/golosd --rpc-endpoint=127.0.0.1:8092

    This opens up a RPC port (e.g. at 8092). Currently, authentication
    is not yet available, thus, we recommend to restrict access to
    localhost. Later we will allow authentication via username and
